  <p>I chose this website because it has a relaxed and balanced feel to it. For example, the colors are not overwhelming and they communicate a soothing atmosphere. The music in the background sounds serene and meditative which combines well with the colors and helps create a theme of relaxation. Finally, the hover interaction between the buttons and the flowers is also very satisfying as a user experience because it requires little effort yet produces a beautiful result.  All of these elements tie into each other well and help put the user at ease while at the same time encouraging engagement with the website elements.</p>
