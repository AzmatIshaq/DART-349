      <h2>My Bio</h2>
      <p>My name is Azmat Ishaq. I am a student at Concordia University. I was born and raised in the suburbs of Montreal. I enjoy sports, literature, gaming, learning, writing and so much more. I do not have a background in web design but I am
        hoping to learn and develop that skill set while I am studying in my Computation Arts program. I recently finished my first JavaScript course at Concordia and found that course to be very useful. I now understand computing and programming
        much more, which I think is a useful skill in the modern age. Hopfully, as my skills progress in the area of programming, I can start to construct more sophisticated projects which previously only existed in my imagination.

        I also may or may not be "wanted" by the local pastry consortium, known as LPC. They botched a pastry job and are trying to pin it on me.
