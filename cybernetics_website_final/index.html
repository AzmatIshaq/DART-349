    <p class="show-on-scroll"> Hello student. How about a quick course on Cybernetics. I am
        Norbert Wiener, and I am considered to father of Cybernetics, but let's not get hung up on that.

        Bellow is a diagram of a homeostatic information system.

        Do you know how this kind of system funtions?

    <p>

    Yes, it is feedback loops.

    Furthermore, you're ability to make a choice, and adjust to your environemtn is what makes you a cybernetic system. The term cyber is derived from a greek word meaning to steer a ship. In that sense you, and most cybernetic systems, steer themselves back on track by making adjustments based on feedback.

    For example make a choice from the following options:

    Is Cybernetics based on the idea of course correction, much like a sailboat?

    <p>Can you find the hidden message in the sine wave? Hover over it and give it a try.</p>

    <p> In order to find the hidden message you took several attempts. You overshot the movement slightly and then had to adjust by going slower until you achieved your objective. This ability to sense and adapt to your environment is part of my understanding of Cybernetics.
    <br>
    Try making some interesting patterns with the sine wave. You will notice that same process of adjustment until you reach the desired pattern.

  <section id="cybernetics-levels">

  <P>
    One of the key elements of a cybernetic system is that it is self regulating. For example, all of your neurons in your brains are operating without you needing to do anything. Furthermore they are assembling themselves according to input.
  </p>

  <P>
  One way to think about this is to imagine the operation of a musicboc. The dancing figurine on top of the music box is not self regulating or adaptive. It doesn't sense anything and therefore can only do what it is directly programmed to do.

  <p>
    There are those who claims there are levels to cybernetics.

    The first level is conceptualizing the framework for human and machine systems.

    The second id the focussing on the observer.

    The third is virtualization.

    We are beginning to see virtualization in areas of personal technological enhancement. As well as in medical innovations.

    For example:
